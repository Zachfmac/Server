### Non-English characters:
# The bukkit yaml parser doesn't allow non-english characters, due to this, i've coded a way to add any UNICODE characters:
# Example: %u2623 -> biohazard sign -> (http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2623/index.htm)
#
### Empty messages:
# You can disable any message by leaving it empty just with '', useful when you don't want some death causes to throw a message, or want join messages but not quit messages(for example).

### Enabling this option will BROADCAST extra data about the Death Process, which will be useful to find plugins conflicting with Minecraft standard events.
# You'll be able to check: Victim Name, World Name, Last Damage Cause Type, Last Damage Cause (Reason), and Damager.

#======================================[ PvP Messages ]======================================#
### What to do with PvP Death Messages?
# 1 = Don't Show any of Them.
# 2 = Show them as Usual.
# 3 = ONLY show PvP Death Messages.
PvP_Death_Messages_Handling: 2


#======================================[ World Settings ]======================================#
### Notes:
# IMPORTANT: World names are CASE SENSITIVE!
# Total World Silence: You can add the same world to Muted and Deaf worlds, meaning that the world will NOT send or receive any message(Death/Join/Quit/Kick).

### World Aliases:
# This allows to change world name in messages ("%world" variable) to a custom name instead of the "folder" world name.
World_Aliases:
  world: 'Survival'
  world_nether: 'NetherWorld'
  world_the_end: 'The Moon'
  your_awesome_world: 'Cookie Land'
  
### Muted Worlds: disables ALL(Death/Join/Quit/Kick) outgoing messages from worlds in this list.
Muted_Worlds:
  Enable: false
  World_List:
  - any_world_name
  - hell

### Deaf Worlds: disables ALL(Death/Join/Quit/Kick) incoming messages to worlds in this list.
Deaf_Worlds:
  Enable: false
  World_List:
  - bed_land
  - puzzle_games

### Linking worlds allows worlds to share death/general messages, worlds out of this list will ONLY see it's own messages.
# NOTE: IN A FUTURE I'LL ADD MULTIPLE LINKED GROUPS OF WORLDS! VOTE(POLL) IN THE MAIN PLUGIN PAGE FOR IT!
# Example: as you can see in this list, the worlds "world", "world_nether" and "world_the_end" are linked, so Death and General messages will be shared, if we have another world called "new_world", will only be able to see it's own Death and General Messages.
Linked_Worlds:
  Enable: false
  World_List:
  - world
  - world_nether
  - world_the_end

  
#======================================[ General Messages ]======================================#
### General Messages variables:
# %player  = player name involved in the event.
# %dplayer = player display name.
# %world   = world name in which the player joins/from which player quits/is kicked.

### Enable/Disable custom General Messages:
General_Messages:
  Enable: true
  First_Join: '&5>>> &6The Player &b%player &6has joined the Server for FIRST TIME! &5<<<'
  Recurrent_Join: '&5>>> &aThe Player &b%player &ahas joined the Server! &5<<<'
  Quit: '&5>>> &cThe Player &b%player &chas left the Server! &5<<<'
  Kick: '&5>>> &cThe Player &b%player &chas been Kicked! &5<<<'


#======================================[ Death Messages ]======================================#
### Death Messages variables(tags):
# %player  = victim player name.
# %dplayer = victim player display name.
# %killer  = assassin name (only for player kills, PvP).
# %dkiller  = assassin display name (only for player kills, PvP).
# %weapon_material = material name of the weapon wielded by the killer (only for player kills, PvP).
# %weapon_name = custom display name of the weapon, if there's no name it'll show the material name (only for player kills, PvP).
# %world = world name in which the player died, can be used in any message.
# %mob_type = shows entity type name identified by the server, NOT SUPPORTED FOR RANGED ATTACKS YET! Example: blazes, skeletons etc

### Don't forget to use bukkit colors if you want ===>    http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/42/45/Colors.png
# And other Bukkit Formats ===>    &n = Underlined   ||   &o = Italic   ||   &m = Strike-through   ||   &l = Bold   ||   &k = Magic   ||   &r = Reset Format

### Some Examples:
# Example for Creeper Message = '&2%player &Elikes to hug &CCreepers&E, he is a pill of dust now...'
# Example for PvP Message = '&2%player &Ewas slain by &Ckiller&E, wielding his mighty &C%weapon_material'

### Finally, you can add/modify/remove all the random messages you wish, when a death occurs, a random message from the list will be chosen.
# By default (as you can see below) each death cause has 1-3 random messages, but you can add from 0 to infinite (0 means no message).
