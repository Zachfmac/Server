version: 1.5.3
general:

    # Is regeneration enabled? Setting this to false will globally disable the plugin from working.
    enabled: true
    worlds:
    # Shall players be teleported to the spawn of the world they are on if the chunk has been regenerated?
    # If you do not leave this as true, you might find players log back in and are stuck in a wall.
      teleportOfflineInChunkToWorldSpawn: true
      # Define the name of the worlds you wish to DO NOT wish to regenerate. 
      # Optionally, you can set isBlacklist to false and this becomes a whitelist.

      definedFactions:
      - WILDERNESS
      # Roles who can use the /regenerator chunk command for their own faction.
      # Valid options include: LEADER, OFFICER, MEMBER, RECRUIT, NEUTRAL, TRUCE, ENEMY
      # NOTE: All Relations to the LEFT of the one you selecet above, will automatically be valid also.
      # This does not work in factions defined above. This means you should only put Safezone, Warzone, Wilderness style factions in the above list.
      # If you do not wish to allow for this feature to work, do not assign any players the "regenerator.regen" permission node (and set the below to LEADER for safety).

      # Permission nodes
      # Command: /regenerator regen
      # Permission Node: regenerator.regen
      # Override Node: regenerator.regen.force (or OP) - this bypasses factions protections.
